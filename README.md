# Goals and Objectives, Motivation
The objective of this web application is to provide an interactive environment to explore the displacement of black residents in pink line serviced zip codes following its opening. It was my goal, that with this application, policymakers and officials can better inform their decisions on transit-oriented development and how those policies affect people. This will also allow other public users to more immersively experience and understand how transit-oriented development could lead to gentrification and displacement.

# Spatial, Temporal Scale
Data in this project was aggregated to the zip code level to accurately reflect the composition of the communities living there. Data was pulled from two separate decenniel census: 2000 and 2010, before and after the opening of the pink line in Chicago in 2006.

# Data sources & definitions:
All data used to create the dashboard is available online free of charge. All data was sourced from either the Chicago Open Data Portal or the decennial census (2000 and 2010).

For each variable, the percent change was calculated by the difference between decennial census values in 2000 and 2010. Variables selected from each year's census were:
- Total home ownership
- Total home ownership (white)
- Total home ownership (black)
- Total home rentership
- Total home rentership (white)
- Total home rentership (black)

# Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work
While this project does provide an interesting look at how the pink line displaced black residents, it does have considerable limitations that make it insufficient for official use. Due to time constraints on this project, I was only able to gather data for these variables on one of the more recent rail lines that opened up in Chicago, the pink line. In the future, it is important that data be gathered for before and after the opening of other rail lines as well. A plethora of other variables could also be added to gain a better sense of how the opening of these rail lines affected the communities. This, of course, would also involve gathering historical decennial census data.
